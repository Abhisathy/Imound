# Imound
Imound is an application that brings images to life by embellishing it with sounds associated with the objects in the image frame. Imagine having an image and to be able to recreate the experience of being at the image scene by listening how the image sounds. We use a machine learning based image classifier to detect significant objects in the image scene, then search for an appropriate sound corresponding to each object using an API call and finally, add these sounds as a background audio for the image. 
## Applications
Imound could prove to be a way for the visually impaired to experience the scene of the image without actually seeing it. It could also be used by bloggers to bring life to their photos and share a realistic experience.

## Awards
Placed 3rd at the At&T Entertainment Hackathon 2018 at Berklee College of Music for Best Entertainment Solution.
